# FragmentCommunication
## In Class Exercise using an Activity to communicate between fragments

* Review the Fragment Transactions in your FragmentsTest project from the previous [In-Class Activity: Fragments](/courses/1163585/assignments/6361577)
* Fork and then Clone this repository
* Follow along with the [Android Fragment Basics Example](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/fragments/communicating.html) as you
    1. Add the Item Fragment to the activity layout onCreate()
    2. Update the list of items in DummyContent
    3. Require the Activity to Implement the Interface
    4. Deliver a Message to the Simple Fragment to update its view to show the selected item number
* If you have time, experiment with implementing Fragment Transition Custom Animations like the [Card Flip Animation](http://developer.android.com/training/animation/cardflip.html) for the simple fragment.
